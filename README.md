# ML-fairness-and-Bias
Investigating ML fairness and Bias using two datasets: 1) German dataest 2) Adult Dataset. Both datasets can be found on the UCI website. 
ML Bias is an important topic when it comes to the ethical part of ML. In this report we investigate methods how to mitigate bias in LR classifier
and how could this affect the accuracy of the classifier (i.e Bias/Accuracy tradeoff). 
The explanation of the code and the results could be found in the attached report.
